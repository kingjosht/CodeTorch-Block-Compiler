## CodeTorch Block Compiler

test

This repository contains a modified version of **TurboWarp** (itself a modified version of Scratch) adapted for the CodeTorch project.

### Building
```
git clone https://github.com/CodeTorchNET/CodeTorch-Block-Compiler
cd CodeTorch-Block-Compiler

npm ci

nano .env # modify/create .env files (read more below)

npm start # starts it at localhost:8601
```

the .env accepts the following:
```
APP_NAME=CodeTorch
FORCE_EMBED=false # you should probably leave this false
COLLABORATION_DEV_MODE=false

APP_DOMAIN=USELESS_FOR_MOST_DEV_CASES
API_HOST=USELESS_FOR_MOST_DEV_CASES
ASSET_HOST=USELESS_FOR_MOST_DEV_CASES
EXTENSION_HOST=USELESS_FOR_MOST_DEV_CASES
DEFAULT_CLOUD_HOST=USELESS_FOR_MOST_DEV_CASES
TRUSTED_IFRAME_HOST=USELESS_FOR_MOST_DEV_CASES
COLLABORATION_HOST=USELESS_FOR_MOST_DEV_CASES
